Welcome to RezT

The RezT application framework for PHP.

Quick Start
-----------
RezT is specifically designed to be flexible with regards to how you structure
your code.  This quick start shows one way of creating an application.

### Create A Package
First, you'll want to create a package to hold your application.  Inside the
`package` directory, create a new directory called `site_app` or whatever you
want to call your package.

    mkdir REZTROOT/package/site_app

./serve.php                 Application host
./package/chat/serve.php    Application
